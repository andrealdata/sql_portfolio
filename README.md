About Me:<br>
Welcome! I'm Andrea, an experienced data analyst who passionate about using data to help people. This portfolio showcases a SQL project working with a churn rate dataset and building visualizations. I selected this project so that I could expand my knowledge of customer-based data.

Project Title: Churn Risk Analysis<br>
Primary goal of the analysis: This goal of this project was to identify which accounts may be at risk for churn and signs of disengagement.

Database: MySQL using Dbeaver<br>
Languages: SQL<br>
Visualization: Looker<br>

Key Findings<br>
Finding 1: There are 10 high risk accounts. 30% of Retail accounts are at high risk of churn, totaling 1,032,854 in annual revenue that could be lost.<br>
Finding 2: There are 4 premium plans at high risk, totaling 2,190,717.<br>
Finding 3: There are 11 low risk accounts with the majority being on the Basic plan.<br>

Method:<br>
Data Collection: I got the csv datasets from a ChatGPT prompt.<br>
Data Cleaning: I did some data profiling and general EDA in the csvs. Once uploaded to the database, I handled for some date formatting.<br>
Analysis Approach: I assigned points to various metrics to identify their risk value. These metrics were avg_csat_score (customer_satisfaction), days_since_last_login, ticket_count, and avg_resolution_hrs.<br>
