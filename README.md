About Me:
Welcome! I'm Andrea, a data analyst and data enthusiast passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights. This portfolio showcases my SQL projects, where I work with datasets to perform analysis, create visualizations, and derive actionable insights.

Sales Project: This is a dataset of sample_superstore combined with the most recent census data to get the median household income. The data was combined in dbeaver and loaded to Tableau. In Tableau I have visualized several sales metrics and compared spend by county to the median household income.
